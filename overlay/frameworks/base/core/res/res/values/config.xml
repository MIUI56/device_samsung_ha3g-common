         and less churn of the storage media.

    <!-- The database synchronization mode when using Write-Ahead Logging.
         From https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous:
         WAL mode is safe from corruption with synchronous=NORMAL, and probably DELETE mode is safe
         too on modern filesystems. WAL mode is always consistent with synchronous=NORMAL, but WAL
         mode does lose durability. A transaction committed in WAL mode with
         synchronous=NORMAL might roll back following a power loss or system crash.
         Transactions are durable across application crashes regardless of the synchronous setting
         or journal mode. The synchronous=NORMAL setting is a good choice for most applications
         running in WAL mode.
         Choices are: FULL, NORMAL, OFF. -->
